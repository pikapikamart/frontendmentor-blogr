## My process

It is fun building this website, this is my first frontend mentor challege. I did this since i'm having a break from my freelance projects and I decided to make a hobby of creating 1 website project everyday from frontend mentor. Well the solution posting is new to me so I kinda got late from creating it since i'm confused about it, but creating the project is really, really fun and I recommned it to make 1 project everyday or 1 project every 2 days, depending on your free time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript 
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

I learned that by creating this website, this challenge, I saw that I can easily accomplish projects if I put focus on it, and really put my effort doing it

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
